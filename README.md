# Factory Method Design Pattern, in Swift 3.0

Inspired on [github ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift](https://github.com/ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift)

The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.

I implemented a second example, the one present in [Design Patterns book by Head First](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do). An implementation in Java can be found in [adagio/PizzaStores - factory method branch](https://github.com/adagio/PizzaStores/tree/factorymethod)

There is a slight difference, between this two examples. The one from Head First considers Creator and Concrete Creator classes. We have implemented NYStylePizzaStore, but not a PizzaStore protocol.
